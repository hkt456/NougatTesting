**Moment of Inertia**

- Rotational inertia (scalar quantity), resists changes in angular velocity \(\omega\).

- Calculation of moment of inertia must use the rotational axis as the origin.

- Parallel axis theorem: \(l=l_{CM}+Md^{2}\)

- Perpendicular axis theorem: \(l_{\!z}=l_{\!\chi}+l_{\!\chi}\).

**Continuous Mass Case**

- Refers to an extended mass

- Can be viewed as "many slices" of

small masses \(dm\) with distance-squared \(r^{2}\)

joined together

\[l=\int r^{2}\,dm\]

with \(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\) in 3D.

**Moment of Inertia >> Example:**

**Serway problem 10.16**

A block of mass \(\mathrm{m_{1}}\,=\,2.00\) kg and a block of mass \(\mathrm{m_{2}}\,=\,6.00\) kg are connected by a massless string over a pulley in the shape of a solid disk having radius \(R\,=\,0.250\) m and mass \(M\,=\,10.0\) kg. The fixed, wedge-shaped ramp makes an angle of \(\theta\,=\,30.0^{\circ}\) as shown in Figure. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.360 for both blocks. (a) Draw force diagrams of both blocks and of the pulley. Determine (b) the acceleration of the two blocks and (c) the tensions in the string on both sides of the pulley.

**End of Lecture Reflection Questions:**

1) Are you able to distinguish between discrete and continuous mass problems when calculating moment of inertia?

2) Are you able to recognize situations when parallel axis theorem or perpendicular axis theorem applies?

3) Are you able to deploy \(dm\) in various dimensions just like how it is used in CM calculations?

4) Are you able to form the extra equations coming from angular quantities and rotational Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) law \(\tau=I\alpha\)? Then are you able to juggle the algebra to solve for the quantity required by the question?
**Digression (Non-examinable) >> Inertial Reference Frames**

Imagine a spaceship in deep space far away from anything and there is a ball floating in it and the observer will conclude that no force is acting on the ball.

So who is correct? Is there a force acting on the ball?

_Passon in Inertia frame is covered, there is no force._

Importance of Centre of Mass Reference Frame

The above diagram shows the motion of a rotating spanner through space with no forces acting on it. We see that if we see that the center of mass is the only point on the spanner that is non-accelerating - making it a special and important reference.
