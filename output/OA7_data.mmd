Your last submission is used for your score.

The top edge of a thin rectangular metal plate with a mass of 2.80 kg is attached to a horizontal rod parallel to the edge of the plate. The plate hangs from this rod and is free to rotate about it without friction. The vertical height of the plate is 40.0 cm. The plate is pulled to the right until it makes an angle of 28.0\({}^{\circ}\) from vertical and then released from rest. At the same time, a piece of clay is tossed at the plate, moving to the right. At the moment the plate reaches vertical, moving left, it collides with the clay. The piece of clay strikes the plate at its bottom edge, moving to the right perpendicular to the plate at the moment of impact. Its mass is 330 g and its speed just before impact is 150 cm/s. The clay sticks to the plate after impact.

(a) What is the angular speed (in rad/s) of the plate the instant before it collides with the clay? (Round your answer to at least two decimal places.)

(b) What is the angular speed (in rad/s) of the plate-clay system immediately after the collision?

(c) What is the magnitude of the maximum angular displacement from the vertical (in degrees) that the plate-clay system will reach after the collision?

A diver with a mass of 54.0 kg is rotating head-over-heels in mid-air, at an angular speed of 2.00 revolutions per second, in a tucked position (that is, with arms, legs, and head pulled into a tight ball). In this position, the diver can be modeled as a solid sphere with a radius of 0.550 m, rotating about its center. Just before landing, while still in the air, the diver fully extends her arms and legs. In this position, she can be modeled as a long, thin rod, with a length of 1.90 m, the distance from her feet to her fingertips. The rod rotates about the center, with the axis of rotation perpendicular to the length of the rod.

What is her angular speed (in revolutions per second) with her arms and legs fully extended?

A stiff, thin, metal rod with negligible mass is free to rotate in a vertical plane about pivot point \(P\), as shown in the figure below. The rod has three small beads (labeled 1, 2, and 3 in the figure), all with the same mass \(m\), attached to it as shown. The rod is held horizontally and then released from rest at time \(t=0\).

Find all results below in terms of the mass \(m\), distance \(d\), and acceleration due to gravity \(g\).

A small wad of clay with a mass \(m\) is moving to the right at speed \(\nu_{p}\), as show in figure (a) below, when it strikes the edge of a thin rod.

The rod, which has a mass \(M\) and length \(d\), is initially at rest and is free to pivot around a mostly frictionless axle through its center and perpendicular to the page at point \(O\). The clay projectile sticks to the rod and the rod begins to rotate at an angular speed \(\omega\), as shown in figure (b).

(a) We wish to find the angular momentum and fractional change in kinetic energy after the collision. What is the appropriate analysis model to use in order to do this?

A disk of mass \(m\) is attached to a lightweight, taut string which keeps it in circular motion, as shown in the figure below.

The disk slides on a horizontal table with negligible friction at speed \(\nu_{i}\) and the radius of its circular path is \(r_{i}\). The string passes through a small hole in the table and is initially held in place. The string is then slowly pulled downward so that the radius of the circular path decreases to \(r\). (Unless otherwise stated, use the following as necessary: \(m\), \(\nu_{i}\), \(r_{i}\) and \(r\).)

What is the speed of the disk when the radius is \(r\)?

(b) What is the tension in the string when the radius is \(r\)?

(c) How much work is done by the hand as it pulls the string downward to decrease the radius of the circular path from \(r_{i}\) to \(r\)?

(d)* **What If?** If the string rubs against the side of the hole as it is pulled, so that a constant frictional torque of magnitude \(\tau\) is exerted on the system, what is the final speed of the puck if it takes time \(t\) for the string to be pulled? (Use the following as necessary: \(m\), \(\nu_{i}\), \(r_{i}\), \(r\), and \(t\).

You are attending a county fair with your friend from your physics class. While walking around the fairgrounds, you discover a new game of skill. A thin rod of mass \(M=0.575\) kg and length \(\ell=2.40\) m hangs from a friction-free pivot at its upper end as shown in the figure.

The front surface of the rod is covered with Velcro. You are to throw a Velcro-covered ball of mass \(m=1.45\) kg at the rod in an attempt to make it swing backward and rotate all the way across the top. The ball must stick to the rod at all times after striking it.

A uniform rod of mass **349** g and length 50.0 cm rotates in a horizontal plane about a fixed, vertical, frictionless pin through its center. Two small, dense beads, each of mass \(m\), are mounted on the rod so that they can slide without friction along its length. Initially the beads are held by catches at positions 10 cm on each side of center, and the system is rotating at an angular speed of **35.0** rad/s. The catches are released simultaneously, and the small beads slide outward along the rod.
