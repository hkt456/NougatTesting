# Nougat Model Testing Repository

This repository contains my testing code for the **Nougat: Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents** model. 

The code in this repository is used to experiment with and evaluate the capabilities of Nougat for converting scanned academic documents into structured, machine-readable text. This includes testing various features such as handling complex mathematical formulas, document structure recognition, and performance comparisons with other OCR models.

## Report

For a detailed report on the Nougat model, including a summary, its mechanisms, advantages, and potential drawbacks for industry-based projects, please refer to the following Google Docs link:

## Usage

To run the tests, clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in the test scripts. 

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Jupyter Notebook (if applicable)

Please don't make me write the installation instructions for these dependencies. You know how to do it.
